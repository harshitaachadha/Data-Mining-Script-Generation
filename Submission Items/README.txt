Predicting TV Series Ratings using Ensemble Learning


Overview

The "Predicting TV Series Ratings using Ensemble Learning" project focuses on utilizing ensemble learning techniques to forecast user ratings for episodes of the iconic sitcom "Friends." The project involves a comprehensive analysis of scripts from all episodes of "Friends" and employs advanced data mining methodologies to extract key features. The cornerstone is a stacked model using boosted regression decision trees to analyze textual script data, aiming to reveal intrinsic elements impacting audience ratings.
